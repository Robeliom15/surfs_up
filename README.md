# surfs_up

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this code is to get more information in June and December, so we can check if the shop is sustainable throughout the year. We do not know if the shop will be busy during the colder parts of the year.


## Results

### June Temperatures

### December Temperatures

-  The average temperature for June and December are 75 and 71, which is close to each other.

- The minimal temperature June reaches is 64 while December reaches 56, which is a notable gap when compared to the other data. 

-  The maximum temperature June reaches is 85 while December reaches 83, which is a small difference.

## Summary

Overall the location seems to be great for opening the new surf shop. Looking at the data between December and June shows that the weather is consistent throughout the year. It would be good to add more data to get a more detailed picture. Data that shows the difference in precipitation the area gets would also help get a better idea of whether the location is ideal. Getting data on the speed the wind gets could also help since the temperature of the wind could affect sales.
